# PROJECT 1 – OFFLINE PROTOTYPE (LAPTOP DEMO)



---

## 🧩 OVERALL SETUP (ONE MACHINE)

Everything runs on **one computer**.

**Hardware**

* Laptop
* uploading of image

**Software (all local)**

* One program for:

  * Image uploading
  * OCR
  * Filtering
  * Processing
  * Storage
* One local dashboard

No internet. No APIs. No cloud.

---

## 1️⃣ IMAGE uploading

### What you actually do in prototype

You simulate the real device like this:

* Place an image showing:

  ```
  PM2.5 : 85
  AQI : 120
  ```
* we upload image

### What runs

* A small script that:

  * uploading manually which is saved locally
    ```
    captured_display.jpg
    ```



---

## 2️⃣ OCR MODULE (LOCAL, OFFLINE)

### What actually happens

* The program reads `captured_display.jpg`
* OCR engine runs locally
* Extracts raw text

### Example output

```
"PM2.S : 85 AQI-120"
```

### Important point

OCR is **not perfect**, and you must acknowledge that.

What you say:

> “OCR output is raw and may contain errors, so we don’t use it directly.”

That’s engineering maturity.

---

## 3️⃣ FILTERING & VALIDATION MODULE (CORE LOGIC)

This is where you win points.

### What the program does

* Removes symbols (`:`, `-`)
* Corrects common OCR mistakes:

  * `S → 5`
  * `O → 0`
* Extracts numbers using fixed patterns
* Validates ranges

### Example

OCR gives:

```
PM2.S : 85 AQI-120
```

After filtering:

```
PM2.5 = 85
AQI = 120
```

### Rejection logic

If OCR gives garbage:

* That reading is skipped
* Program waits for next image

What you say:

> “We use rule-based filtering and range validation to ensure only reliable values are processed.”

---

## 4️⃣ DATA PROCESSING MODULE (MEANING MAKER)

This module converts **numbers → understanding**.

### What it does

* Takes filtered values
* Applies fixed thresholds

Example:

* AQI ≤ 50 → Good
* AQI 51–100 → Moderate
* AQI > 100 → Poor

So:

```
AQI = 120 → Status = Poor
```

### Final processed record

```
Time: 17:30
PM2.5: 85
AQI: 120
Status: Poor
Location: Fixed
```

### What you say

> “This layer separates raw data from decision logic, making the system easy to modify later.”

That line sounds senior.

---

## 5️⃣ LOCAL STORAGE MODULE (OFFLINE)

### What you use

For prototype:

* CSV file or
* Local lightweight database

### What gets stored

Each reading is saved as a row:

```
Timestamp | PM2.5 | AQI | Status
```

### Why storage matters

* Enables history
* Enables graphs
* Enables debugging

What you say:

> “Local storage allows time-based analysis without internet dependency.”

---

## 6️⃣ DASHBOARD MODULE (LOCAL DISPLAY)

### What dashboard reads

* Reads data from local storage
* Fetches:

  * Latest reading
  * Historical readings

### What dashboard shows

* Current AQI and status
* PM2.5 value
* Simple graph:

  * Time vs AQI

### How often it updates

* Refreshes every few seconds
* Shows new data as it comes

What you say:

> “The dashboard provides real-time and historical air-quality visibility for a specific physical location.”

---

## 🔁 COMPLETE PROTOTYPE FLOW (WHAT YOU SAY CONFIDENTLY)

> “In the prototype, a camera captures the air-quality display image, OCR extracts raw text, software filters and validates the values, processing logic determines air quality status, the data is stored locally, and a local dashboard displays both current and historical air-quality information. All components run offline on a single computer.”

Say this slowly. You’ll see heads nod.

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY SHOW IN DEMO

1. Image of air-quality display
2. OCR output (even if imperfect)
3. Clean filtered values printed/logged
4. CSV/database file growing with time
5. Dashboard updating graphically
